# To Do List

This "chapter" of the Hobo Manual is just here to let you know what needs to come before the manual is considered complete.

Note that this is just a set of reminders - it doesn't reflect the structure that the manual may eventually have.

 - Multi-model forms

 - Automatic named scopes

 - Miscellaneous model extensions
     
 - Controllers and routing
 
 - The Rapid tag library
 
 - Rich types
 
 - Users and authentication
 
 - Subsites
 
 - Migration generator
 
Wow - that's a lot to do! Have I forgotten anything? (post on hobousers if I have)
