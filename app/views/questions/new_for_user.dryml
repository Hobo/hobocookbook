    <p>If you have an idea for a recipe that you think would be generally useful to Hobo programmers, please post your request
    here. If you have a more specific question about something you're stuck with, the
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hobousers/">Hobo Users</a> group is probably the best place for that.</p>
